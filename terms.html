                    <ul>

                <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or
                    setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
                    monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has
                    been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
                    communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in
                    the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.</p>

                <p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an
                    industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.</p>
